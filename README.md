**Holochain application indexing engine for distributed apps which run on holochains**

**[Code Status:](https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/milestones?direction=asc&sort=completeness&state=all)** Broken.  This app is currently broken and doesn't run.  We'll be fixing it soon.

## Installation

Prerequiste: [Install holochain](https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/#installation) on your machine.
You can install holodex very simply with this:

``` shell
hcdev init -cloneExample=holodex

```

## Usage

This is a mixin bridged so you don't run it directly and has no UI, instead apps bridge to it.

### Tests
To run all the stand alone tests:

``` shell
hcdev test
```

Tests currently broken
